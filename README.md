Experimenting with Ultrasound simulation software packages

# Getting Started with FOCUS

FOCUS allows simulating pressure fields generated by single transducers and phased arrays.

Download and install focus.  Add the `Core/` and `Core/MEX/` directories to your matlab path, e.g. by running something like the following in the Matlab console (passing the correct download location for your setup).

    addpath('/opt/FOCUS_2012b_mac_v796/Core')
    addpath('/opt/FOCUS_2012b_mac_v796/Core/MEX/')

Try some examples by running any of the scripts in the `examples/` dir in this repo. These are examples taken from the Quick Start document that comes with FOCUS.
